# Final-Project-Transforming-and-Analyzing-Data-with-SQL

## Project/Goals
> The purpose of the project is to show that I am filimiar with SQL and able to work and analyze 
databases by using PgAdmin. Also to create databases myself with the correct data types and connection 
between table. 

## Process
### Creating Database 
> To create database I uploade csv file to PgAdmin, considering data types, number of columns.
### Analysing and Cleaning Data

revenue was for unknown city. 

## Future Goals
To start working with databases online. Start using complex quiries. Memorize more clauses by practising
