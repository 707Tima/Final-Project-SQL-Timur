# Final-Project-Transforming-and-Analyzing-Data-with-SQL

## Project/Goals
> The purpose of the project is to show that I am filimiar with SQL and able to work and analyze 
databases by using PgAdmin. Also to create databases myself with the correct data types and connection 
between table. 

## Process
### Creating Database 
> To create database I uploade csv file to PgAdmin, considering data types, number of columns.
### Analysing and Cleaning Data
> I looked at the data and tried to understand "What kind of data it is?". visually, tried
to understand where data is missing or wrong. 
> I started cleaning process. I havent created a copy of table, so I decided to overwrite the tables.
in more details I described my process in `cleaning_data` file.

## Results
> The results showed us that people in different countries have different preferences in products. 
It also shows us that revenue is varying from month to month. I had some assumptions that the 
highest renenue is during Fest season in Dec, but our database does not contain this information. 
Another finding shows that people in some countries spend more time on browsing sites, then others. 
## Challenges 
> The challenge is that a lot of information was not available and instead of NULLs it was something 
like `not available in demo dataset`. It was difficult to analyze data from cities because the biggest 
revenue was for unknown city. 

## Future Goals
> To start working with databases online. Start using complex queries. Memorize more clauses by practising 
and put more efforts to solve problems at the root.
